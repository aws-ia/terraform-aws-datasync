# AWS DataSync Terraform sub-module

Deploys a DataSync Agent on AWS. Agent deployment is required for syncing data from on-premise to AWS or between AWS cloud storage services. Requires the Datasync VM to be deployed first using the module [vmware-datasync-agent](https://github.com/prabirsekhri/terraform-aws-datasync/tree/develop/modules/vmware-datasync-agent) or the [ec2-datasync-agent](https://github.com/prabirsekhri/terraform-aws-datasync/tree/develop/modules/ec2-datasync-agent). For an end to end examples refer to the [examples](https://github.com/prabirsekhri/terraform-aws-datasync/tree/develop/examples) directory.
