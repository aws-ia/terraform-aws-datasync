# AWS DataSync Terraform Module

This repository contains Terraform code which creates resources required to run a [DataSync task](https://https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/) to sync data within AWS and from on premises to AWS or vise-versa.

AWS DataSync supports a wide variety of file and object storage systems on-premise and in AWS to facilitate data transfer.

For on-premises storage transfers : DataSync works with the following on-premises storage systems:

- Network File System (NFS)
- Server Message Block (SMB)
- Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS)
- Object storage

For AWS storage transfers: DataSync works with the following AWS storage services:

- Amazon S3
- Amazon EFS
- Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
- Amazon FSx for Lustre
- Amazon FSx for OpenZFS
- Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

The module requires a source DataSync location and destination Datasync location to be declared. The location types supported in the examples are S3 and EFS. For more details regarding the DataSync Locations S3 and EFS and their respective arguments can be found [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/datasync_location_s3.html) and [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/datasync_location_efs).

## Usage with DataSync Locations and Task Module

- Link to EFS to S3 same account sync example for in-cloud transfers : [efs-to-s3](examples/efs-to-s3/)

### [DataSync Locations Module](modules/datasync-locations/)

S3 Location

```hcl
module "s3_location" {
  source = "../../modules/datasync-locations"
  s3_locations = [
    {
      name = "datasync-s3"
      s3_bucket_arn            = "terraform-s3-bucket-12345"
      subdirectory             = "/"
      create_role              = true
      s3_source_bucket_kms_arn = "aws_kms_key_arn"

      tags = { project = "datasync-module" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that for Datasync s3 Locations module allows you to create a DataSync IAM role by setting ```create_role = true```. This IAM role has the required [S3 permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#create-role-manually) allowing DataSync service to seamlessly access the S3 bucket.

EFS Locatoin

```hcl
module "efs_location" {
  source = "../../modules/datasync-locations"
  efs_locations = [
    {
      name = "datasync-efs"
      # In this example a new EFS file system is created in efs.tf
      efs_file_system_arn            = "arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-east-1:123456789012:filesystem/fs-123456789"
      ec2_config_subnet_arn          = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:subnet/subnet-1234567890abcde"
      ec2_config_security_group_arns = [arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:security-group/sg-1234567890abcde]
      tags                           = { project = "datasync-module" }
    }
  ]

  # The mount target should exist before we create the EFS location
  depends_on = [aws_efs_mount_target.efs_subnet_mount_target]

}
```

The examples also includes "aws_kms_key" resource block to create a KMS key with a key policy that restricts the use of the key based on same acccount and cross account access requirements. Refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) for information.

### [DataSync Task Module](modules/datasync-task/)

Two locations, one as source and other as destination are required for the [Datasync task configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-task-how-to.html). Once the locations are configured, they need to be passed as source location arn and destination location arn to the next module for Datasync task configuration.For more details regarding the DataSync Task configuration and their respective arguments can be found [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/datasync_task).

  Example :

```hcl
module "backup_tasks" {
  source = "../../modules/datasync-task"
  datasync_tasks = [
    {
      name                     = "efs_to_s3"
      source_location_arn      = module.s3_location.s3_locations["datasync-s3"].arn
      destination_location_arn = module.efs_location.efs_locations["datasync-efs"].arn
        options = {
          posix_permissions = "NONE"
          uid               = "NONE"
          gid               = "NONE"
        }
      schedule_expression = "cron(0 6 ? * MON-FRI *)" # Run at 6:00 am (UTC) every Monday through Friday:
    }
  ]
}
```
